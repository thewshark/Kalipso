# MIS Communicator Update

We have included all the MIS Package, the KDriver's and the MIS 64 bits version.

We strongly advise for compatibility reasons to use the 32 bits version. Don't forget in this version you have a permissions tab in the communication tab, if you do not set them accordingly it won't communicate.
